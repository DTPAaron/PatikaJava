## ZOO MANAGMENT SYSTEM


- Animals are characterized by species in groups such as:

    - Horses (horses, zebras, donkeys, etc.),
    - Felines (tigers, lions, etc.),
    - Rodents (rats, beavers, etc.)

- Most of the information stored about animals is the same for all grouings:

    - Species name, weight, age, etc.

- The system should be able to get the dosage of specific drugs for each animal -> getDosage()

- The system should also be able to calculate the feed times -> getFeedSchedule()

- The logic for the system to perform these function will be different for each grouping. For example, the feeding algorithm will be different for horses and different for tigers.
